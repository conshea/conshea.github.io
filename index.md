## Welcome to Conor's First GitHub

This will initially be a project for my networking class, but it will continue to be updated and likely transformed into a virtual display of our school's projects!

### Skills

As it is only our second semester, my proficiency in programming skills is limited to:

```markdown
# Programming Skills
- HTML/CSS
- C# Console Applications
- C# Form Applications
- Javascript
- PHP
- Rudimentary Python

# Miscellaneous
- Carpentry
- Renovations
- Juggling

```

### Projects

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/conshea/flashy-template/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact
